    <h4>I am putting some informations about HTML 5</h4>
    <p><b> <i> HTML5, or Hypertext Markup Language 5, is the fifth and final major version of the markup language used to structure and present web. <br> It's made up of three codes: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which work together to describe a page's structure, presentation, and interactive effects. HTML5 improves on previous versions of HTML by adding new features and attributes, and by simplifying syntax for document structuring. For example, HTML5 includes integrated mixed media features, such as video, that were previously handled by external plugins. HTML5 also helps developers create more dynamic and interactive web content, such as websites and web applications.</i></b></p> <br>
